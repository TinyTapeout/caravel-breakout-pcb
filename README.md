# caravel-breakout
A set of breakouts/carrier boards for the Caravel ASIC used in eFabless MPW runs and a little FPGA adapter for simulating the TinyTapeout design, to be used alongside the [TT-02 demo board](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tinytapeout-02-pcb) and/or other custom designs.

The ASIC board designs are based on the original breakout [published here](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board/tree/main/hardware/caravel_breakout), optimised for single-sided surface mount assembly and ease of integration into other projects.

Design files are in KiCad 6 format, custom library parts can be found in [this external repo](https://github.com/omerk/ok-kicad-libs).
