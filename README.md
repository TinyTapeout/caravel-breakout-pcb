# caravel-breakout

This is a small breakout/carrier board for the Caravel ASIC used in eFabless MPW runs, optimised for surface mount assembly and ease of integration into other projects. It is based on the original breakout design [published here](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board/tree/main/hardware/caravel_breakout).

Design files are in KiCad 6 format.
