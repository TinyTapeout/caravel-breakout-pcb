# caravel-breakout-pcb - deprecated

> This repo is deprecated. Use [TinyTapeout/breakout-pcb](https://github.com/tinytapeout/breakout-pcb) instead.

A set of breakouts/carrier boards for the Caravel ASIC used in eFabless MPW runs and a little FPGA adapter for simulating the TinyTapeout design, to be used alongside the [Tiny Tapeout 4+ Demo Board](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-demo-pcb), the [Tiny Tapeout 1-3 Demo Board](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt123-demo-pcb), and/or other custom designs.

The ASIC board designs are based on the original breakout [published here](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board/tree/main/hardware/breakout), optimised for single-sided surface mount assembly and ease of integration into other projects.

Design files are in KiCad 6 format, custom library parts can be found in [this external repo](https://github.com/omerk/ok-kicad-libs).
